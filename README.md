🌳 Decision Tree Implementation
This project demonstrates how to implement and visualize a Decision Tree classifier using scikit-learn. We use the popular Breast Cancer dataset from sklearn.datasets to classify tumors as benign or malignant.

📌 Features
Load and preprocess the dataset

Train a Decision Tree classifier

Visualize the decision tree

Evaluate model performance using accuracy

Display a confusion matrix

🧠 Algorithms Used
Decision Tree Classifier (from sklearn.tree)

Gini Impurity or Entropy (configurable as the splitting criterion)

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

scikit-learn

matplotlib

seaborn

pandas
